# Containers Artwork

This is a repository for designers contributing illustrations and artwork to the container org projects to store those designs and track their work via issues, etc.

This is also a repository for container project team members or anyone using these projects wanting to promote them to find high-quality, vetted artwork for doing so.

This repo is maintained by Máirín Duffy <duffy@redhat.com>. If you would like to help out as a designer, feel free to reach out to her, or also feel free to dive in on any open issues or take a look at the ideas.md file to see some ideas we have for artwork to be created.
